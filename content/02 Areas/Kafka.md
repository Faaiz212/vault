### Kafka

![[_bin/images/Data Engineering/clip_image043.jpg]]

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to store and process streams of records. It is written in Scala. It builds real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between applications, and also builds real-time applications that transform data into streams. 

Kafka uses a messaging system for transferring data from one application to another. As seen below, we have the sender, the message queue, and the receiver involved in data transfer.
