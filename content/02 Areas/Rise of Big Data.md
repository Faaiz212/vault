# Rise of Big Data

## The Rise of Big Data

Back in the day, there was limited data generation. Hence, storing and processing data was done with a single storage unit and a processor, respectively. In the blink of an eye, data generation increases by leaps and bounds. Not only did it increase in volume but also its variety. Therefore, a single processor was incapable of processing high volumes of different varieties of data. Speaking of varieties of data, you can have structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

This chart is analogous to how Jack found it hard to harvest different types of fruits single-handedly. Thus, just like Jack’s approach, analysts needed multiple processors to process various data types.

Multiple machines help process data parallelly. However, the storage unit became a bottleneck resulting in a network overhead generation

To address this issue, the storage unit is distributed amongst each of the processors. The distribution resulted in storing and accessing data efficiently and with no network overheads. As seen below, this method is called parallel processing with distributed storage.

This setup is how data engineers and analysts manage big data effectively. Now, do you see the connection between Jack’s story and big data management?
