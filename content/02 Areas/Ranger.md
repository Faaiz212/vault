Ranger is a framework designed to enable, monitor, and manage data security across the Hadoop platform. It provides centralized administration for managing all security-related tasks. Ranger standardizes authorization across allÂ [Hadoop components](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/hadoop-tutorial/what-is-hadoop "Hadoop components"), and provides enhanced support for different authorization methods like role-based access control, and attributes based access control, to name a few.
