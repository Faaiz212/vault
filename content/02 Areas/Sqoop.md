### Sqoop

![[_bin/images/Data Engineering/clip_image025.jpg]]

[Sqoop](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/hadoop-tutorial/sqoop "Sqoop")Â is used to transfer data between Hadoop and external datastores such as relational databases and enterprise data warehouses. It imports data from external datastores into HDFS, Hive, and HBase.

As seen below, the client machine gathers code, which will then be sent to Sqoop. The Sqoop then goes to the Task Manager, which in turn connects to the enterprise data warehouse, documents based systems, and RDBMS. It can map those tasks into Hadoop.
