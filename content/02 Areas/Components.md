areas: [[Hadoop]]

## What is Hadoop?

Hadoop is a framework that uses distributed storage and parallel processing to store and manage big data. It is the software most used by data analysts to handle big data, and its market size continues to grow. There are three components of Hadoop:

Hadoop [[HDFS]] - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/hadoop-tutorial/hdfs "Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)") is the storage unit.

Hadoop [[MapReduce]] - [Hadoop MapReduce](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/hadoop-tutorial/mapreduce "Hadoop MapReduce") is the processing unit.

Hadoop [[YARN]] - [Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN)](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/hadoop-tutorial/yarn "Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN)") is a resource management unit.
