# Importance of Hadoop

areas:[[Hadoop]]

## Why Is Hadoop Important?

Hadoop is a beneficial technology for data analysts. There are many essential features in Hadoop which make it so important and user-friendly.

The system is able to store and process enormous amounts of data at an extremely fast rate. A semi-structured, structured and unstructured data set can differ depending on how the data is structured.

Enhances operational decision-making and batch workloads for historical analysis by supporting real-time analytics.

Data can be stored by organizations, and it can be filtered for specific analytical uses by processors as needed. 

A large number of nodes can be added to Hadoop as it is scalable, so organization’s will be able to pick up more data.

A protection mechanism prevents applications and data processing from being harmed by hardware failures. Nodes that are down are automatically redirected to other nodes, allowing applications to run without interruption. 

Based on the above reasons, we can say that Hadoop is important.
