### Knox

![[_bin/images/Data Engineering/clip_image047.jpg]]

Apache Knox is an application gateway used in conjunction with Hadoop deployments, interacting with REST APIs and UIs. The gateway delivers three types of user-facing services:

Proxying Services - This provides access to Hadoop via proxying the HTTP request

Authentication Services - This gives authentication for REST API access and WebSSO flow for user interfaces

Client Services - This provides client development either via scripting through DSL or using the Knox shell classes

Let us now take a look at the workflow system, Oozie.
